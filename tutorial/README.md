# Tutorials

This section is a small and incomplete collection of tutorials for doing quantum chemistry.
It is basically just a reminder for myself, so that I can also look up, 
what I might have forgotten to tell my students, or what I probably have told them.

Most of these assume a basic understanding of the shell, 
and the other software outlined in the [recommentations](../misc/recommended-software.md),
especially the [tools for g16](https://github.com/polyluxus/tools-for-g16.bash) repository.
