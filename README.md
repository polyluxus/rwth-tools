# RWTH-tools

This is a small collection of scripts and other files, which are or were (more or less) 
helpful in operating the RWTH cluster(s).

There should be seperate README files in each subdirectory explaining details.

This probably goes without saying, but here we go anyway:
There is also absolutely no warranty in any case. 
If you decide to use any of the scripts or files, it is entirely your resonsibility.
