# JabRef

This directory contains ia script which is a wrapper to
the JabRef java file. 
It will find the most recent `JabRef-*.jar` in the install directory
(where the run script is located), 
or update it via [GitHub](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref).

From their [website jabref.org/](http://www.jabref.org/):

> JabRef is an open source bibliography reference manager. 
> The native file format used by JabRef is BibTeX, 
> the standard LaTeX bibliography format. 
> JabRef is a desktop application and runs on the Java VM (version 8), 
> and works equally well on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.

## Installation & Usage

Copy this script to a location where you would like to also store
the downloaded java files.
I suggest `~/local/jabref/`.
For nicer access, create a softlink in a directory which is on 
your `PATH` to the script.
I suggest `~/bin`.
The execute it with 
```
runJabRef.bash [debug] update 
```
to get the latest release.
The debug switch gives some statements, if something does not go according to plan.
Without any wrapper switches, it will simply call the most recent java file.

```
runJabRef.bash [debug] <JabRef arguments>
```
A very brief description is given with the `-h` switch.

JabRef requires Java 8.
JavaFX is not included in every runtime or development kit, 
therefore they recommend Oracle Java 8. 
However, since the recent license change, the Oracle packages have been removed from CLAIX18.
The installed OpenJDK packages that shall replace them do not include JavaFX.
As an alternative you can install ZuluFX, further instructions on how to do that can be found
in the modules tree of this repository: [ZuluJDK](../../modules/modulefiles/source/zulujdk/README.md).
