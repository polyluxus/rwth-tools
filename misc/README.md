# Miscellaneous

This directory contains scripts which I did not really know where to put else.

There are supposed to be fun little scripts in here, 
that don't serve a particular purpose, or
other tools that may be handy at one point or another.

For example `ii2l.bash` asks the question whether or not it is too late,
while `runJabRef.bash` is a wrapper to JabRef.

I have started some data sheets with values that are often needed;
they are available as pdf files with their LaTeX source files.
Some of them might be available as markdown files, too.
