# Modulefiles

These are the example module files, some editing required, 
and some additional software, too.

The `LOCAL` directory only contains links that lead back 
to the `source` directory and `.version` files setting the defaults.

The `source` directory contains the actual module files 
(which would need the edit).

_Note:_ There are currently no instructions on how to install the
additional software. If I have any time, I will add them in a
future version.
