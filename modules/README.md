# Modules

This directory contains scripts for the use with modules. 
They are tailored to be used on the RWTH cluster.

Also included are example files for a local module path.
They use some functions from RWTH specific features,
but can probably easily be exported to other hosts.

## Installation

I recommend copying this directory to `~/local`.
See the subdirectories for a little bit more detail.

## Content
### Modulefiles

These are the example module files, some editing required, 
and some additional software, too.

### Test scripts

These scripts are inteded to test whether modules can be loaded correctly.

### Wrapper scripts

These scripts wrap around an executable to set environment variables.
