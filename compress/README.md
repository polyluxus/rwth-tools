# rwth-compress.sh

This is a small script which submits a job to the queueing system 
to compress a directory into an archive file.

## Usage
 
```
rwth-compress.sh [opt] <target_(base)_filename> <source_directory>
```

The script tries to guess from the extension which action to use;
where it will default to first create a tar archive and use zstd to compress it.
(Currently supported: .tgz, .tar.gz, .tar.gzip, .tar.zstd [default]; WIP: .zip, .7z)

I therefore recommend installing [zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd) before
using this script.

## Options

| Switch     | Function |
|:-----------|:---------|
| `-u`       | Strip user level from source directory. (Try to change to user level directory before archive creation.) |
| `-q <ARG>` | Select a queueing system; supported: slurm [default], bsub. |
| `-A <ARG>` | Account (bsub: project) to use. |
| `-k`       | Keep the submission script. |
| `-n`       | Do not submit (dry run). |
| `-h`       | Print a help message. |
| `-D`       | Debug mode with (much) more information. |

## Miscellanious

If `LOGFILES` is set and a directory, the script will use it to store the logfiles.
If `~/logfiles` exists (and `LOGFILES` is unset, it will use this destination.
If neither applies, `HOME` will be the destination for logfiles. 
(TODO: Choose location.)
