# This is a text/configuration file intended for the use on the RWTH RZ cluster.
# The file should be used in conjunction with the init-modules script from 
# https://github.com/polyluxus/rwth-tools
#
# Lines starting with a hastag will be skipped.
# To load a list of modules on startup, include their names here one per line:
texlive/2018
openbabel/2.4.1
python/3.6.5
# (Note that the above lines need the software to actually be installed 
# and set up with the module files from this repository.)
